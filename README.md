# Blocky Thing
### (A Roblox Game)


<br>

## What is this?
Using:

- [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
- [Typescript][typescript]
- [Roblox-Ts][robloxts]

Creating a Minecraft-esque game because I felt like it.
This came about because my friends couldn't run Minecraft modpacks, so I sought out to create a literal clone and emulate various mods (with permission) to create an enjoyable experience that can run on lower-spec machines via the Roblox Game Engine.

This is not an intended replacement for our favourite Blocky Game, nor will it accompany it in any way, and needless to say, I am not affiliated with _Microsoft_ or _Mojang AB_ in any way.

## Future Progress Updates
I should probably create a folder where I can push text documents with a small changelog of sorts, to document changes in the code and any problems I'm having with the code at the time.
It'll make for a nice memoir of code.
